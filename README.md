## Introduction

This is a data set from a semi-conductor manufacturing process. It had 1567 Number of Instances & 591 number of sensor instances. Semiconductor manufacturing is an extraordinarily complex process with hundreds of steps involved in it. Each of these steps has a feedback signal coming from the sensors. Since semiconductor manufacturing is expensive so even a small failure in one of the steps might result in catastrophic loss hence the large number of sensors to detect any anomaly. Process engineers are required to detect an anomaly during the manufacturing as soon as possible because these products are manufactured in an environment to achieve great precision on a scale of nanometer, but the existing univariate and multivariate control charts fail to do so with such high volume of data taken during the manufacturing process. This end-to-end solution package is a generic solution for a Smart Factory Operation using the semiconductor data set. Industries already have a Planned Maintenance schedule in the manufacturing sector which informs us when to carry out the maintenance of machineries involved in manufacturing depending on the running hours of that particular machinery or the time between overhauls but we need to have a predictive maintenance scheduling (especially in the case of Smart Factory Manufacturing) which after learning from the data available, predicts about the failure before its occurrence and thus reducing the time & money lost during the process of manufacturing. In other words, if we are provided with observations that has been generated by an unknown stochastic dependency then our goal is to infer a law that will be able to predict the future observations correctly based on the same dependency to maintain a high process yield in manufacturing. This is a classification problem of predicting a pass or fail for the manufactured semiconductor wafer based on the feedback coming from the sensors. There is total 590 sensors and one more feature of pass and fail state. Using these 590 sensors total 1567 observations are collected and classification model is made using the binary response of these sensors.
